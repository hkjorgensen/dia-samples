# geo-trip demo

This demo builds on earlier examples, and considers a common scenario: detecting whether a user/device is within a certain zone. This can enable all sorts of location-based experiences. In the demo we use a very simple notion of a zone: a circular area which is defined by a lat/lon and radius.

TIP: Use geo-playground and click on the map to get the coordinates for your own zones

With a current location, we can then calculate whether the point intersects a zone, or how far it is from the middle. In the demo, we show how to define a set of zones, and maybe trigger other kinds of behaviour based on which zone is intersected. In its current state, we just show the 'raw' information.

The actual computation is handled by `geolib`, which does all the hardwork. We just have to call `geolib.isPointInCircle()`.

Some interaction design challenges:
* Can you trigger interaction when a user enters or leaves a zone for the first time?
* Can you set up a behaviour if a user proceeds through zones in a particular order (sort of like a treasure map?)
* Can you try using a polygon-based zone? (see the geolib documentation for more)

## Fake Locations

To make testing easier, you can fake your location. Open up Chrome's console, and click the icon that looks a bit like '>=', to toggle the console drawer. Click "Emulation" and then "Sensors". From there, turn on "Emulate geolocation coordinates", and type in the lat/lon you want to fake, and then refresh the page.
