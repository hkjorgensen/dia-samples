# pointer-world

Shows how to send and receive pointer events across different clients. In this set up, pointermove events are sent to all other clients, so you can see the combined touches/moves.

It also shows a few other useful techniques.

One is how the page automatically deletes old circles after a period of inactivity. Whenever you are inserting stuff into the DOM like in this example, it's a good idea to think about how you're going to clean up after yourself. The DOM is not meant for tracking 1000s of objects. (As an aside, a more efficient way of implementing this sample is using the HTML canvas, but that's another story). We use jQuery's .each method to iterate over every matching element in a page. setTimeout is used to run a function every 2 seconds.

Another useful trick is creating a relative coordinate sysem based on the size of the window/device rather than the absolute cursor x/y position. This is way we can normalise over difference in screen size and all users are on the 'same page' so to speak.


Things to try:
* At the moment only 'pointermove' events are sent and handled. Can you make a small change to respond to 'pointerup' as well?
* Can you implement "hit testing" so that if two cursors overlap something happens?
* The pointer removal code could be smarter. Eg, for touch, we could use pointerup/down or pointerenter/leave to help us to determine when pointers should be removed
